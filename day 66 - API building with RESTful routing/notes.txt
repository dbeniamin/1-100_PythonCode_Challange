# REST = REpresentational
#        State
#        Transfer


MOST important rules of RESTful API:
1 - Use HTTP request Verbs
        -> GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

2 - Use specific Patterns or Routes / Endpoint URLs
        -> refer to RESTful_routing.jpg


PUT vs PATCH
PUT -> replaces an entire item or entry
PATCH -> replaces specific pieces of data for one entry
