# 1-100_PythonCode_Challenge

A while back I did a few smaller coding challenges and improved my knowledge drastically. 
All the concepts I learned helped me understand automation and how it can be used with python and several frames.
Given that, I decided to start a longer and more complex challenge and finish it. I do know that I won't be able to keep the 100 days fit in real 100 days, and that is fine.
Some problems might be solved differently than the teacher, and that is fine, we don't all have to think exactly the same.
I will update this and move along with coding, as I enjoy it a lot.

All comments are made by me in places I thought they are needed and for my own thinking process.
