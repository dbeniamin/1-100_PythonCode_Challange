# 1-100_PythonCode_Challenge

This repository contains code and projects completed during the "100 Days of Python" bootcamp by Angela Yu. This bootcamp is an intensive programming course that covers a wide range of topics in Python programming
Tracking personal progress and learning process while tackling the challenges and the projects that are listed in the course material.

All the concepts I learned helped me understand automation and how it can be used with python and several frames.
Given that, I decided to start a longer and more complex challenge and finish it. I do know that I won't be able to keep the 100 days fit in real 100 days, and that is fine.
Some problems might be solved differently than in the course material.
This repository will be updated constantly while moving along with coding.
# Aiming for "Progress, not Perfection" on a daily basis.
All comments are made by me in places I thought they are needed and for my own thinking process.
Some comments might contain obvious information for some people, at the time of making the comment the issue felt important to me and helped me understand the concepts.

Feel free to look, fork, copy the files and use them, see how the logic works and refer to the comments in order to get a better understanding. Also comment or add stuff if you feel it is necessary.

Update list:
day 07 - Hangman - 09.01.2024

Contains The Hangman game and a diagram that was used to break down the game. The game is made using separate files that are imported to main.py, instead of having all the code clutter one file only.
