Level 1 - store the pass in the db - on the server side
Level 2 - encryption - shuffle the chacters based on a key
Level 3 - hashing - does not decrypt it backwards - math wizardry that is almost impossible to turn it back
Level 4 - hashing and salting - add a random set of characters and then apply hashing

register -> type pass -> hashing -> makes the password jiberish -> save to db
login -> type pass -> hashing -> makes the password jiberish -> compared to the pass alerady saved in db

early encription - Ceasar Cipher => letter substitution cipher based on a shift pattern
