<!---HTML tags--->

<!--HTML Heading starting from h1 to h6--->

<h1> Heading 1 </h1>
<h2> Heading 2 </h2>
<h3> Heading 3 </h3>
<h4> Heading 4 </h4>
<h5> Heading 5 </h5>
<h6> Heading 6 </h6>

<!-- good practice -->
<!-- don't have more than one h1 element -->
<!-- dont skip a level when creating header elements i.e. from h1 to h3 -->
<!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements  - reference documentation for heading elements -->


<!-- HTML Paragraph tags -->

<p>This is a Paragraph</p>
<p>This is a Paragraph</p>


<!-- void elements -->
<!-- can be used like <br> or <hr> with the same output -->
<!-- an element that you are forbidden to put any element inside the tag -->

<!-- <hr /> => horizontal rule , a horizontal line shown between two elements -->

<p>This is a Paragraph</p>
<hr /> 
<p>This is a Paragraph</p>
  
<!-- dont add a <br /> element at the end of each paragraph because it will cause accesibility issues for people using readers -->
<!-- <br /> => break element , can be used to separate content in diffrent lines i.e in case of poems , same paragraph but diffrent lines-->

<br />

<!-- preview the below content without the break element -->
<p>
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
</p>
